# GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions ‚ú®

This document provides guidance on how to use custom instructions with GitHub Copilot in VS Code to tailor AI responses to your specific needs and coding practices.

## Introduction to Custom Instructions

Custom instructions enable you to describe common guidelines or rules to get responses that match your specific coding practices and tech stack. Instead of manually including this context in every chat query, custom instructions automatically incorporate this information with every chat request.

## Types of Custom Instructions

VS Code supports several types of custom instructions, targeted at different scenarios:

1. **Code Generation Instructions**: Define how Copilot should generate code
2. **Test Generation Instructions**: Specify guidelines for generating test code
3. **Code Review Instructions**: Set rules for code review feedback
4. **Commit Message Generation Instructions**: Define format and content for commit messages
5. **Pull Request Title and Description Generation Instructions**: Set standards for PR descriptions

## Ways to Define Custom Instructions

1. **Instruction Files**: 
   - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: A single file with instructions for your workspace
   - `.instructions.md` files: Multiple files for specific tasks

2. **VS Code Settings**: Configure instructions directly in settings.json

## Example Configuration in settings.json

```json
"github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [
  {
    "text": "Always add a comment: 'Generated by Copilot'."
  },
  {
    "text": "In TypeScript always use underscore for private field names."
  },
  {
    "file": "general.instructions.md"
  },
  {
    "file": "db.instructions.md"
  }
],
```

## Enabling Instruction Files

To use instruction files in VS Code:

1. Enable the setting: `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles`
2. Create a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file at the root of your workspace
3. Add your guidelines using markdown format

## Experimental: Split Instruction Files with New Directives (VS Code 1.100+) üß™

As of VS Code version 1.100, you can split the former `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file into multiple, purpose-specific instruction files using new directives. This feature is currently marked as **experimental**.

See the [VS Code release notes](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_100#_experimental-split-instruction-files) for more details.

### How to Use Split Instruction Files

- Place individual instruction files in the `.github/` folder, such as:
  - `code-generation.instructions.md`
  - `test-generation.instructions.md`
  - `code-review.instructions.md`
  - `commit-message.instructions.md`
  - `pr-description.instructions.md`
- Each file should contain guidelines relevant to its purpose.
- VS Code will automatically detect and apply these files if the experimental feature is enabled.

### Enabling the Experimental Feature

1. Ensure you are using VS Code 1.100 or later.
2. Enable the setting: `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles`
3. Organize your instruction files as described above.

> **Note:** 
>  This feature is experimental and may change in future releases. Refer to the:
> - [VS Code release notes 1.100 ] (https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_100#_prompt-and-instructions-files) for updates.
> - the [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_specify-custom-instructions-in-settings) 
for more information.
 
 You can also specify custom instructions in the settings.json file for more granular control. ‚öôÔ∏è

## Examples by Purpose

See the example files in the `.github` folder for each purpose:

- Code Generation Instructions: `.github/code-generation.instructions.md` [link](.github/code-generation.instructions.md)
- Test Generation Instructions: `.github/test-generation.instructions.md` [link](.github/test-generation.instructions.md)
- Code Review Instructions: `.github/code-review.instructions.md` [link](.github/code-review.instructions.md)
- Commit Message Instructions: `.github/commit-message.instructions.md` [link](.github/commit-message.instructions.md)
- Pull Request Description Instructions: `.github/pr-description.instructions.md` [link](.github/pr-description.instructions.md)

## Best Practices for Custom Instructions üìù

1. Keep instructions short and self-contained
2. Don't refer to external resources in the instructions
3. Split instructions into multiple files by topic
4. Use the `applyTo` property to target specific files or folders
