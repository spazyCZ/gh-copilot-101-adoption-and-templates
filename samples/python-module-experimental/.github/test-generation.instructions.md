# Test Generation Instructions

- Create separate test classes for new code, covering different scenarios and edge cases.
- Place tests in designated test files or directories, using consistent naming (e.g., test_<module>_<type>.py).
- Split mock and integration tests into separate files—never combine them.
- Set up data before running tests to ensure a clean state.
- Mark all AI-generated tests for manual review (see below):
  - Add above each test function:
    # === TEST GENERATED BY AI (GitHub Copilot) ===
    # Please manually review this test for correctness and completeness.
  - Or use:
    @pytest.mark.ai_generated
- Follow the Arrange–Act–Assert structure.
- Include TODO comments where logic may be unclear.
- Prefer readable variable names and avoid magic values.
