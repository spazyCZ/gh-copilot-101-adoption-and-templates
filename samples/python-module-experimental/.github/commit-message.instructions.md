# Commit Message Instructions

- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Start with a short summary (max 50 characters).
- Add a blank line, then a detailed description if needed.
- Reference related issues or PRs.
- Note any performance optimizations, testing improvements, or documentation updates.
- Use conventional commit types if your project requires (feat, fix, chore, etc.).
